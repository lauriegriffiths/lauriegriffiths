Hello there, I'm Laurie. I'm a freelance software engineer based in Fukuoka, Japan.

I'm interested in new web technologies, natural language processing, AI, VR and microcontroller projects.

When I'm away from the keyboard I like to go running, play the piano and cook British food.

I also run and manage the Fukuoka Engineer Cafe, a city supported co-working and maker space. We aim to support the engineering community in Fukuoka and provide a place for people to build their skills.  We're based in a striking 100 year old red brick building in central Fukuoka.
