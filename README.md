Hello there, I'm Laurie. I'm a freelance software engineer based in [Fukuoka,Japan](https://goo.gl/maps/9g3GZ9oeMJAg8r2UA)

I'm interested in new web technologies, NLP, AI, VR and microcontroller projects.

When I'm away from the keyboard I like to go running, play the piano and cook British food.

I also run and manage the [Fukuoka Engineer Cafe](https://engineercafe.jp/en), a city supported co-working and maker space. We aim to support the engineering community in Fukuoka and provide a place for people to build their skills.  We're based in a striking 100 year old red brick building in central Fukuoka.
